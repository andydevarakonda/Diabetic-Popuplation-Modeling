# Diabetic-Popuplation-Modeling
In this project, we are dealing with a system that mathematically models the total population
size of the number of diabetics around the world. We use this differential model to predict the
changing number of diabetics around the world. We can control this model by using a control
system, that moderates the number of new cases of diabetes with respect to the total number of
diabetics with and without complications. Another factor is introduced to the system which is the
number of diabetics with health complications. The useful applications of a diabetic predicting
system are analyzing the total diabetic size in certain famished regions. We can also use this
system to provide information for scientists to provide scientific information that can potentially
lead to insulin development, and possibly a permanent cure. Research regarding the risk factors
that come along with diabetes can be further enhanced and studied with information gathered
from this system. The need for control is to provide a basic response to the required control of
the differential model.
